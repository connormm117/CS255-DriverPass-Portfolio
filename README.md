# DriverPass – System Analysis & Design (CS 255)

This repository contains my portfolio artifacts for **CS 255: System Analysis and Design**:
- **Project One:** Business Requirements Document (DriverPass)
- **Project Two:** System Design Document (DriverPass), including UML diagrams

These deliverables demonstrate requirements gathering, blended object/process modeling, and clear communication of technical concepts to nontechnical stakeholders.

## Module Eight Portfolio Reflection

### Summary of the DriverPass Project
DriverPass is a system designed to help students prepare for their driving tests through two main capabilities: **online practice exams** and **scheduling on-the-road lessons** with instructors. The system tracks student progress, delivers feedback, and protects user data. My work focused on translating the client’s needs into a clear design using a blended approach to **object** and **process** modeling.

### What I Did Well
I translated the interview-based requirements into **clear, consistent UML diagrams** and structured documents that are easy for both developers and nontechnical stakeholders to follow. I prioritized readability and alignment with client goals so the design can be implemented without confusion.

### What I Would Revise
If I could revise one area, I would expand the **class diagram** with method stubs and tighter relationships (e.g., composition vs. aggregation) to further accelerate development hand-off. More detail there would reduce questions during implementation.

### Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
I extracted functional and nonfunctional requirements directly from the DriverPass interview transcript and mapped them into use cases, activity flows, and data structures. Centering design decisions on **user outcomes** (easy scheduling, accurate feedback, secure access) ensures the product is practical and valuable. Ignoring user needs risks building a technically correct system that doesn’t solve the right problems.

### My Approach to Designing Software
I break problems into small, testable parts and model them before coding:
- Start with **use cases** and user journeys
- Detail flows with **activity diagrams**
- Specify interactions via **sequence diagrams**
- Define structure with a **class diagram**
- Iterate with feedback and keep communication **jargon-free** for stakeholders

Going forward, I’ll continue to use iterative, user-centered techniques and maintain traceability from requirements → models → implementation.
